Fitness: distance of each path in a chromosome
Select Algorithm: 1. remove the worst chromosome in the current population (n(new) = n(old) - 1 ) 2. Tournament selection
Crossover Algorithm: Cycle Recombination with 90% crossover rate (changeable)
Mutation: Insert Mutation with 2% mutation rate (changeable)
